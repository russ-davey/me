Hi! I'm Russ, as a senior Software Engineer with a passion for developing reliable and scalable software solutions, I have
expertise in using GoLang, Clojure, and functional programming to build microservices & distributed systems.

I am well-versed in queue-based event-driven architectures, such as Kafka and PubSub, and I have experience in building 
RESTful APIs & webhooks that are easy to use and maintain. In addition, I have a strong understanding of DevOps practices, 
including continuous integration and deployment, infrastructure as code, and monitoring and alerting.

My experience in Kubernetes and serverless technology, along with my expertise in deploying and managing complex software 
applications, makes me a valuable asset to any organization. I am committed to delivering high-quality software solutions 
that meet the most demanding requirements, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and knowledge.

If you are looking for a talented and experienced Software Engineer who can drive innovation and deliver exceptional results 
through the power of DevOps, let's work together to build something great.
